Scripts run outside of the rails context, so they can't autoload project classes or gems. Two ways to fix this are:

1) Start script with a #!bin/rails runner shebang which makes the script run under the rails runner interpreter rather
    than the ruby interpreter. The rails runner interpreter knows about the rails application context. Doesn't work on
    W4ndows.

2) require 'environment.rb'. This file is basically what sets all the application context, so if included the script can
    be run even with the default ruby interpreter, it can be debugged, etc. Works 4 W4ndows.
